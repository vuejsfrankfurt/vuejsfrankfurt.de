## Vue.js Frankfurt Kickoff Party!

It’s finally happening! We are excited to welcome you all to the Vue.js Kickoff Party!

At this event we hope to get to know as many of you as possible and brainstorm about thoughts and ideas for Vue.js Frankfurt. For example, if you would like to give a talk/workshop at a future event or know anyone who would be interested, we would love to hear from you. Victoria will also just be back from the Vue.js London conference and will share the latest news from the Vueniverse!

**Recap**: Our kickoff event was a great success thanks you to you, our members, and of course our wonderful sponsors: [FastBill](https://www.fastbill.com/), [melsicon](https://melsicon.de/), [Bryter](https://bryter.io/) and [msg](https://www.msg.group/). The venue was provided by FastBill and wonderfully decorated with Vue.js’ colours and stickers! To read a recap of our event, there is an article written by Anett ([@emsuiko](https://twitter.com/emsuiko)) [published on Frontend RheinMain](https://www.frontend-rheinmain.de/2018/09/30/vuejs-frankfurt-kickoff.html) :smiley:
